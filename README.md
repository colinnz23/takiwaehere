## Our Submission 
Our main submission is contained within the Web App folder. To use it, simply visit [here](https://jekb2019.github.io/takiwaehere/). 

## Introduction
The web app shows the depth levels of water across different types of maps (Satellite, map, road). There are options to filter by vehicle. Not suitable will indicate locations which are inaccessible by the vehicle. Suitable indicates locations which are accessible by the vehicle. This current app is less accurate than the files contained in the Full Accuracy Map HTML Files. This is to save in processing time for the web application and other technical difficulties.

## Extra Information
Please refer to the following html files for a more precise data of our web application. 

Our full interactive maps can be accessed using the following .html files. 
“all*.html” files display the depth of water for all pixels which are flooded. 
“boat*.html” files show the routes which are accessible by boat where depths are at least 1m.
allSattel.html 
boatMap.html
boatSattel.html
allMap.html
